# Paper Review

## General Requirements
- Header with Paper-ID + Paper Title information
- Intro text / letter start  section (coming already with a standard thank you message which might be followed up with a summary of the made changes)
- The template should not automatically come with mandatory author information as some journals require double blind reviews where the names of the authors are disclosed. 
- A "editor / reviewer" section which starts the question -> answer procedure for this specific person. This should include an individual and citable counter such that the questions and answers can be numerated per editor / reviewer (exactly as in the uploaded word example.) and also referenced to like we cite figures or tables within a document.
- A "question" command / environment which holds the next question / comment from a reviewer and offers to add a label to this question if internally cited.
- An "answer" command / environment which holds the next answer and offers to add a label to this question if internally cited.
